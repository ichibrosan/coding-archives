I hereby license the enclosed source code comprising my
PowerC DOS Utilities for use by the public. The code may
embedded in new applications, but I would appreciate it
if the documentation included "Portions licensed from
Douglas W. Goodall".

These utilities are written in ANSI C and are meant to be
compiled using the Power C compiler from Mix Software. The
compiler may be purchased for $19 from them. It comes with
a big book containing examples of the use of all standard
library routines. A fantastic buy at $19.

Please enjoy these programs, I did :-)
